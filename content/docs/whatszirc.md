# What is Zirconium

Zirconium is an operating system based on Linux that redistributes [Niri](http://github.com/yalter/niri) and [Dank Material Shell](https://danklinux.com/) as it's main desktop interface. It is meant to be low maintenance, so in order to achieve that it utilizes [Bootable Containers](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/bootc/getting-started/) as a deployment technology for stable, predictable deployments on user systems.
